This plugin is quite simple; it will produce a list of the plugins you have installed in textpattern. To use the plugin, simply place the tag `<txp:rsx_plugins_table />` in a form or page template. The plugin will produce a table, which you can style with CSS if you feel so inclined.

The plugin is rsx_plugins_table.txt, while rsx_plugins_table.php is the source. More information can be found at the [Textpattern Forum thread for this plugin.](http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=5007)

You can use the parameter `show_inactive` to decide if you want to list active or inactive plugins. If it is set to 1, which is the default, inactive plugins will be listed as well as active plugins. If it is set to 0, then only active plugins are displayed.

You can use the parameter `show_description` to decide if you want to include the description of the plugin in your list or not. If it is set to 1, which is the default, the description of the plugin will be listed. If it is set to 0, then no description will be listed.
