This plugin will display a list containing the basic information about the
plugins you currently have installed in your textpattern system. The list can
be styled using CSS, as the list has been given the class
"plugins-list" To use, simply include the tag
<txp:rsx_plugins_list /> anywhere you want this list to be
displayed.

More information can be found at the Textpattern Forum thread for this plugin. [http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=5007]

You can use the parameter "show_inactive" to decide if you want to list active or inactive plugins. If it is set to 1, which is the default, inactive plugins will be listed as well as active plugins. If it is set to 0, then only active plugins are displayed.

You can use the parameter "show_description" to decide if you want to include the description of the plugin in your list or not. If it is set to 1, which is the default, the description of the plugin will be listed. If it is set to 0, then no description will be listed.
